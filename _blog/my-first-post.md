I know what you're thinking. "Gee guys, yet ANOTHER github pages developer portfolio site with sub-par HTML/CSS." 

Yeah yeah whatever, might as well make another todo-list app and grind leetcode like everyone else yada yada. 

Well, I intend to be a part of the solution rather than the problem in that regard. This whole site is more of a place for me to post the solution to the problems that I couldn't find, and hopefully reach whoever is reading this in the process and save them 20 hours of their life I already lost. Such is the way of the programmer, after all.

I warn you that the code, projects, or whatever nonsense came flying out of my brain/fingers you see here, may not be of the most professional quality, but it sure as hell is my own.

Oh, and it's worth mentioning that because I love preserving my retinas and obsessively having everything I make match a certain aesthetic, this whole site's colorscheme may be a bit unorthodox. 

...


Well- I warned you.
I hope you like red and black.

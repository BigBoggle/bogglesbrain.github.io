## About Me

I am a Computer Science and Computer Engineering student at the University
of Kentucky, and I am potentially seeking a Masters Degree in either field. 

I switched to Linux about a year ago and never looked back. 
I love old games, Terminal Wizardry, 3D Printing, and Mechanical Keyboards.

### <u>Tech I Use</u>

## Hardware

### Laptop - Lenovo Thinkpad T480

| Specs            | Hostname - Aksis |
|:--------------|---------------:|
| CPU | Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8350U (8) @ 3.60 GHz |
| RAM | 16 GB DDR4 @ 2400MHz |
| GPU |  Intel UHD Graphics 620 @ 1.10 GHz|


The Thinkpad replaced my okish gaming notebook style Asus laptop, and it runs better than I could've imagined on 8+ year old hardware.

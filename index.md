## About Me

I am a Computer Science and Computer Engineering student at the University
of Kentucky, and I am potentially seeking a Masters Degree in either field. 

I switched to Linux about a year ago and never looked back. 
I love old games, Terminal Wizardry, 3D Printing, and Mechanical Keyboards.

If you like any of these things as much as I do, feel free to reach out!

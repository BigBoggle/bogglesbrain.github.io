##  Here is a comprehensive list of everything I've made.

### <u>Software Projects</u>
- [siva.nvim](https://github.com/BigBoggle/siva.nvim) -> A custom Neovim Color Scheme to match my Linux Desktop
    - What good is ricing your setup if your schemes don't match **EVERYTHING**?

-  [projection.nvim](https://github.com/BigBoggle/projection.nvim.git) -> A project management plugin for Neovim
    - All the solutions for jumping to and from projects for Neovim I found were too complicated or didn't work the way I wanted. This plugin is still buggy, but does indeed do what I wanted it to do.

- [Boggle's Brain](https://github.com/BigBoggle/bogglesbrain.github.io) -> The source of the very website you're looking at now! 
    - A link to the link that contains this link. How meta!

### <u>Hardware Projects</u>
- [prime_perfected](https://github.com/BigBoggle/prime_perfected) -> My first QMK powered split keyboard
- [prime_flex](https://github.com/BigBoggle/prime_flex) -> My current split keyboard, compatible with Vial QMK. 


### <u>In Progress</u>
Some projects I have started, not cleaned up enough, or have barely gotten off the ground.
- snake_eyes -> Teaching Pytorch to play Balatro.
- perfection_complex -> a cyberdeck for the everyday.
